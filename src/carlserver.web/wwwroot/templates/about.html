    <h1>About Me</h1>
    I have been a software developer for 7+ years working on a number of projects both personal and professional. Most of my experience is
    in web technologies including C#, ASP .NET webforms MVC and Web API, and AngularJS. I also have experience writing custom
    modules and widgets for the <a href="http://www.sitefinity.com/">Sitefinity</a> platform. I love notepad and avoid Microsoft Office.

    I enjoy learning about new and old technologies and am trying to get more involved with open source projects on <a href="https://github.com/cwl157">GitHub</a> (starting
    with making some of my personal projects open source, including this website). I also think I drink too much coffee.
