[{"id":1,"title":"Using C# dynamic Keyword To Replace Data Transfer Objects","summary":"For this post I'm going to show 3 examples of using the C# dynamic keyword when deserializing input data instead of using data transfer objects. Many modern applications need to accept data from a variety of sources. Often times we create data transfer objects just to handle requests and responses to and from the data source. Using dynamic in C# reduces the need for data transfer objects and keeps the logic that depends on the 3rd party data source contained to one place.","body":"","author":"Carl Layton","publishedDate":"2017-12-10T06:00:00Z","friendlyUri":"using-c#-dynamic-keyword-to-replace-data-transfer-objects","isPublished":true,"previousPostUri":null,"previousPostTitle":null,"nextPostUri":null,"nextPostTitle":null},{"id":2,"title":"Using Javascript Promises for Application Logic in an AngularJS Service","summary":"The example in this post shows how the $q service can be used to harness the power of javascript promises to perform application logic in an AngularJS application. This can help keep application code organized and separate responsibilities among controllers and services.","body":"","author":"Carl Layton","publishedDate":"2017-12-17T12:00:00Z","friendlyUri":"using-javascript-promises-for-application-logic-in-an-angularjs-service","isPublished":true,"previousPostUri":null,"previousPostTitle":null,"nextPostUri":null,"nextPostTitle":null},{"id":3,"title":"AngularJS Route Resolve Example","summary":"The resolve property is attached to a route in AngularJS to provide a list of dependencies for the route. The data from this list is injected into the route controller and if any of the dependencies are promises, the promise will be resolved before the controller is instantiated. This helps keep the controller clean because any data the controller depends on can be injected into it instead of the controller retrieving that data itself. This post will go through an example of using the resolve property and show the differences between using a resolve property versus putting the fetch code in the controller directly.","body":"","author":"Carl Layton","publishedDate":"2017-12-27T13:00:00","friendlyUri":"angularjs-route-resolve-example","isPublished":true,"previousPostUri":null,"previousPostTitle":null,"nextPostUri":null,"nextPostTitle":null}]
